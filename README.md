# IndieStudio
ECS-powered game made as a school project.

Build this project using CMake, and on Linux preferably. It seems to crash on Windows a lot for reasons that I've failed to identify. Memory leaks indicate it is probably because of a dependency (Raylib or tinyobj) but I'm not sure.

I made the ECS after reading the *Data-oriented design* book by Richard Fabian. It sadly doesn't yield fantastic results, partly because of coding restrictions in the evaluation of the project. On top of that, the scope of the project being too small to actually implement the optimisations it can bring.

However, it was a great way to understand how data-oriented design works, why it is useful and how it can be incorporated in games. It also showed me how this paradigm can greatly help with refactoring.

This project was made in 2020 as part of my curriculum to get my Bachelor's degree.
